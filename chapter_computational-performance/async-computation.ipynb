    "# Asynchronous Computation\n",
    ":label:`sec_async`\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's computers are highly parallel systems, consisting of multiple CPU cores (often multiple threads per core), multiple processing elements per GPU, and often multiple GPUs per device. In short, we can process many different things at the same time, often on different devices. Unfortunately Python is not a great way of writing parallel and asynchronous code, at least not without some extra help. After all, Python is single-threaded and this is unlikely to change in the future. Deep learning frameworks such as MXNet and TensorFlow adopt an *asynchronous programming* model to improve performance,\n",
    "while PyTorch uses Python's own scheduler leading to a different performance trade-off.\n",
    "For PyTorch, by default, GPU operations are asynchronous. When you call a function that uses the GPU, the operations are enqueued to the particular device, but not necessarily executed until later. This allows us to execute more computations in parallel, including operations on the CPU or other GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, understanding how asynchronous programming works helps us to develop more efficient programs, by proactively reducing computational requirements and mutual dependencies. This allows us to reduce memory overhead and increase processor utilization."
