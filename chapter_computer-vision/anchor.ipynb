    "### [**Assigning Ground-Truth Bounding Boxes to Anchor Boxes**]\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an image,\n",
    "suppose that the anchor boxes are $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{n_a}$ and the ground-truth bounding boxes are $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{n_b}$, where $n_a \\geq n_b$.\n",
    "Let's define a matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_a \\times n_b}$, whose element $x_{ij}$ in the $i^\\textrm{th}$ row and $j^\\textrm{th}$ column is the IoU of the anchor box $A_i$ and the ground-truth bounding box $B_j$. The algorithm consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the largest element in matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and denote its row and column indices as $i_1$ and $j_1$, respectively. Then the ground-truth bounding box $B_{j_1}$ is assigned to the anchor box $A_{i_1}$. This is quite intuitive because $A_{i_1}$ and $B_{j_1}$ are the closest among all the pairs of anchor boxes and ground-truth bounding boxes. After the first assignment, discard all the elements in the ${i_1}^\\textrm{th}$ row and the ${j_1}^\\textrm{th}$ column in matrix $\\mathbf{X}$. \n",
    "1. Find the largest of the remaining elements in matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and denote its row and column indices as $i_2$ and $j_2$, respectively. We assign ground-truth bounding box $B_{j_2}$ to anchor box $A_{i_2}$ and discard all the elements in the ${i_2}^\\textrm{th}$ row and the ${j_2}^\\textrm{th}$ column in matrix $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "1. At this point, elements in two rows and two columns in  matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ have been discarded. We proceed until all elements in $n_b$ columns in matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ are discarded. At this time, we have assigned a ground-truth bounding box to each of $n_b$ anchor boxes.\n",
    "1. Only traverse through the remaining $n_a - n_b$ anchor boxes. For example, given any anchor box $A_i$, find the ground-truth bounding box $B_j$ with the largest IoU with $A_i$ throughout the $i^\\textrm{th}$ row of matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, and assign $B_j$ to $A_i$ only if this IoU is greater than a predefined threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the above algorithm using a concrete\n",
    "example.\n",
    "As shown in :numref:`fig_anchor_label` (left), assuming that the maximum value in matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is $x_{23}$, we assign the ground-truth bounding box $B_3$ to the anchor box $A_2$.\n",
    "Then, we discard all the elements in row 2 and column 3 of the matrix, find the largest $x_{71}$ in the remaining  elements (shaded area), and assign the ground-truth bounding box $B_1$ to the anchor box $A_7$. \n",
    "Next, as shown in :numref:`fig_anchor_label` (middle), discard all the elements in row 7 and column 1 of the matrix, find the largest $x_{54}$ in the remaining  elements (shaded area), and assign the ground-truth bounding box $B_4$ to the anchor box $A_5$. \n",
    "Finally, as shown in :numref:`fig_anchor_label` (right), discard all the elements in row 5 and column 4 of the matrix, find the largest $x_{92}$ in the remaining elements (shaded area), and assign the ground-truth bounding box $B_2$ to the anchor box $A_9$.\n",
    "After that, we only need to traverse through\n",
    "the remaining anchor boxes $A_1, A_3, A_4, A_6, A_8$ and determine whether to assign them ground-truth bounding boxes according to the threshold.\n",
