    "method that we will implement\n",
    "in :numref:`sec_ssd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At some scale,\n",
    "say that we have $c$ feature maps of shape $h \\times w$.\n",
    "Using the method in :numref:`subsec_multiscale-anchor-boxes`,\n",
    "we generate $hw$ sets of anchor boxes,\n",
    "where each set has $a$ anchor boxes with the same center.\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "at the first scale in the experiments in :numref:`subsec_multiscale-anchor-boxes`,\n",
    "given ten (number of channels) $4 \\times 4$ feature maps,\n",
    "we generated 16 sets of anchor boxes,\n",
    "where each set contains 3 anchor boxes with the same center.\n",
    "Next, each anchor box is labeled with\n",
    "the class and offset based on ground-truth bounding boxes. At the current scale, the object detection model needs to predict the classes and offsets of $hw$ sets of anchor boxes on the input image, where different sets have different centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the $c$ feature maps here\n",
    "are the intermediate outputs obtained\n",
    "by the CNN forward propagation based on the input image. Since there are $hw$ different spatial positions on each feature map,\n",
    "the same spatial position can be \n",
    "thought of as having $c$ units.\n",
    "According to the\n",
    "definition of receptive field in :numref:`sec_conv_layer`,\n",
    "these $c$ units at the same spatial position\n",
    "of the feature maps\n",
    "have the same receptive field on the input image:\n",
    "they represent the input image information\n",
    "in the same receptive field.\n",
    "Therefore, we can transform the $c$ units\n",
    "of the feature maps at the same spatial position\n",
    "into the\n",
    "classes and offsets of the $a$ anchor boxes\n",
    "generated using this spatial position.\n",
    "In essence,\n",
    "we use the information of the input image in a certain receptive field\n",
    "to predict the classes and offsets of the anchor boxes\n",
    "that are\n",
    "close to that receptive field\n",
    "on the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When the feature maps at different layers\n",
    "have varying-size receptive fields on the input image, they can be used to detect objects of different sizes.\n",
    "For example, we can design a neural network where\n",

    "1. According to our discussions in :numref:`sec_alexnet`, deep neural networks learn hierarchical features with increasing levels of abstraction for images. In multiscale object detection, do feature maps at different scales correspond to different levels of abstraction? Why or why not?\n",
    "1. At the first scale (`fmap_w=4, fmap_h=4`) in the experiments in :numref:`subsec_multiscale-anchor-boxes`, generate uniformly distributed anchor boxes that may overlap.\n",
    "1. Given a feature map variable with shape $1 \\times c \\times h \\times w$, where $c$, $h$, and $w$ are the number of channels, height, and width of the feature maps, respectively. How can you transform this variable into the classes and offsets of anchor boxes? What is the shape of the output?\n",
