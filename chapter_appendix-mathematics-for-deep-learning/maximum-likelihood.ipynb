    "# Maximum Likelihood\n",
    ":label:`sec_maximum_likelihood`\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly encountered way of thinking in machine learning is the maximum likelihood point of view.  This is the concept that when working with a probabilistic model with unknown parameters, the parameters which make the data have the highest probability are the most likely ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Maximum Likelihood Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "This has a Bayesian interpretation which can be helpful to think about.  Suppose that we have a model with parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ and a collection of data examples $X$.  For concreteness, we can imagine that $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is a single value representing the probability that a coin comes up heads when flipped, and $X$ is a sequence of independent coin flips.  We will look at this example in depth later.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to find the most likely value for the parameters of our model, that means we want to find\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmax}} P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\mid X).$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression $P(X)$, a parameter agnostic probability of generating the data, does not depend on $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ at all, and so can be dropped without changing the best choice of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.  Similarly, we may now posit that we have no prior assumption on which set of parameters are better than any others, so we may declare that $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ does not depend on theta either!  This, for instance, makes sense in our coin flipping example where the probability it comes up heads could be any value in $[0,1]$ without any prior belief it is fair or not (often referred to as an *uninformative prior*).  Thus we see that our application of Bayes' rule shows that our best choice of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of common terminology, the probability of the data given the parameters ($P(X \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$) is referred to as the *likelihood*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Concrete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in a concrete example.  Suppose that we have a single parameter $\\theta$ representing the probability that a coin flip is heads.  Then the probability of getting a tails is $1-\\theta$, and so if our observed data $X$ is a sequence with $n_H$ heads and $n_T$ tails, we can use the fact that independent probabilities multiply to see that \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X \\mid \\theta) = \\theta^9(1-\\theta)^4.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice thing about this example will be that we know the answer going in.  Indeed, if we said verbally, \"I flipped 13 coins, and 9 came up heads, what is our best guess for the probability that the coin comes us heads?, \" everyone would correctly guess $9/13$.  What this maximum likelihood method will give us is a way to get that number from first principals in a way that will generalize to vastly more complex situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, the plot of $P(X \\mid \\theta)$ is as follows:"
