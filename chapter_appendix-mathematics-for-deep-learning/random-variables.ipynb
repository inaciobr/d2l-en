    "# Random Variables\n",
    ":label:`sec_random_variables`\n",
    "\n",
    "In :numref:`sec_prob` we saw the basics of how to work with discrete random variables, which in our case refer to those random variables which take either a finite set of possible values, or the integers.  In this section, we develop the theory of *continuous random variables*, which are random variables which  can take on any real value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous random variables are a significantly more subtle topic than discrete random variables.  A fair analogy to make is that the technical jump is comparable to the jump between adding lists of numbers and integrating functions.  As such, we will need to take some time to develop the theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Discrete to Continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the additional technical challenges encountered when working with continuous random variables, let's perform a thought experiment.  Suppose that we are throwing a dart at the dart board, and we want to know the probability that it hits exactly $2 \\textrm{cm}$ from the center of the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we imagine measuring a single digit of accuracy, that is to say with bins for $0 \\textrm{cm}$, $1 \\textrm{cm}$, $2 \\textrm{cm}$, and so on.  We throw say $100$ darts at the dart board, and if $20$ of them fall into the bin for $2\\textrm{cm}$ we conclude that $20\\%$ of the darts we throw hit the board $2 \\textrm{cm}$ away from the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we look closer, this does not match our question!  We wanted exact equality, whereas these bins hold all that fell between say $1.5\\textrm{cm}$ and $2.5\\textrm{cm}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Undeterred, we continue further.  We measure even more precisely, say $1.9\\textrm{cm}$, $2.0\\textrm{cm}$, $2.1\\textrm{cm}$, and now see that perhaps $3$ of the $100$ darts hit the board in the $2.0\\textrm{cm}$ bucket.  Thus we conclude the probability is $3\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this does not solve anything!  We have just pushed the issue down one digit further.  Let's abstract a bit. Imagine we know the probability that the first $k$ digits match with $2.00000\\ldots$ and we want to know the probability it matches for the first $k+1$ digits. It is fairly reasonable to assume that the ${k+1}^{\\textrm{th}}$ digit is essentially a random choice from the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$.  At least, we cannot conceive of a physically meaningful process which would force the number of micrometers away form the center to prefer to end in a $7$ vs a $3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that in essence each additional digit of accuracy we require should decrease probability of matching by a factor of $10$.  Or put another way, we would expect that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\textrm{distance is}\\; 2.00\\ldots, \\;\\textrm{to}\\; k \\;\\textrm{digits} ) \\approx p\\cdot10^{-k}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $p$ essentially encodes what happens with the first few digits, and the $10^{-k}$ handles the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that if we know the position accurate to $k=4$ digits after the decimal, that means we know the value falls within the interval say $[1.99995,2.00005]$ which is an interval of length $2.00005-1.99995 = 10^{-4}$.  Thus, if we call the length of this interval $\\epsilon$, we can say\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\textrm{distance is in an}\\; \\epsilon\\textrm{-sized interval around}\\; 2 ) \\approx \\epsilon \\cdot p.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take this one final step further.  We have been thinking about the point $2$ the entire time, but never thinking about other points.  Nothing is different there fundamentally, but it is the case that the value $p$ will likely be different.  We would at least hope that a dart thrower was more likely to hit a point near the center, like $2\\textrm{cm}$ rather than $20\\textrm{cm}$.  Thus, the value $p$ is not fixed, but rather should depend on the point $x$.  This tells us that we should expect\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{distance is in an}\\; \\epsilon \\textrm{-sized interval around}\\; x ) \\approx \\epsilon \\cdot p(x).$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_pdf_deriv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, :eqref:`eq_pdf_deriv` precisely defines the *probability density function*.  It is a function $p(x)$ which encodes the relative probability of hitting near one point vs. another.  Let's visualize what such a function might look like."

    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we saw the notion of the p.d.f.  In practice, this is a commonly encountered method to discuss continuous random variables, but it has one significant pitfall: that the values of the p.d.f. are not themselves probabilities, but rather a function that we must integrate to yield probabilities.  There is nothing wrong with a density being larger than $10$, as long as it is not larger than $10$ for more than an interval of length $1/10$.  This can be counter-intuitive, so people often also think in terms of the *cumulative distribution function*, or c.d.f., which *is* a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, by using :eqref:`eq_pdf_int_int`, we define the c.d.f. for a random variable $X$ with density $p(x)$ by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(x) = \\int _ {-\\infty}^{x} p(x) \\; dx = P(X \\le x).\n",

    "\n",
    "* $F(x) \\rightarrow 0$ as $x\\rightarrow -\\infty$.\n",
    "* $F(x) \\rightarrow 1$ as $x\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n",
    "* $F(x)$ is non-decreasing ($y > x \\implies F(y) \\ge F(x)$).\n",
    "* $F(x)$ is continuous (has no jumps) if $X$ is a continuous random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the fourth bullet point, note that this would not be true if $X$ were discrete, say taking the values $0$ and $1$ both with probability $1/2$.  In that case\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we see one of the benefits of working with the c.d.f., the ability to deal with continuous or discrete random variables in the same framework, or indeed mixtures of the two (flip a coin: if heads return the roll of a die, if tails return the distance of a dart throw from the center of a dart board).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Means\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are dealing with a random variables $X$.  The distribution itself can be hard to interpret.  It is often useful to be able to summarize the behavior of a random variable concisely.  Numbers that help us capture the behavior of a random variable are called *summary statistics*.  The most commonly encountered ones are the *mean*, the *variance*, and the *standard deviation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *mean* encodes the average value of a random variable.  If we have a discrete random variable $X$, which takes the values $x_i$ with probabilities $p_i$, then the mean is given by the weighted average: sum the values times the probability that the random variable takes on that value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_X = E[X] = \\sum_i x_i p_i.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_exp_def`\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we should interpret the mean (albeit with caution) is that it tells us essentially where the random variable tends to be located.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a minimalistic example that we will examine throughout this section, let's take $X$ to be the random variable which takes the value $a-2$ with probability $p$, $a+2$ with probability $p$ and $a$ with probability $1-2p$.  We can compute using :eqref:`eq_exp_def` that, for any possible choice of $a$ and $p$, the mean is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_X = E[X] = \\sum_i x_i p_i = (a-2)p + a(1-2p) + (a+2)p = a.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we see that the mean is $a$.  This matches the intuition since $a$ is the location around which we centered our random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they are helpful, let's summarize a few properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For any random variable $X$ and numbers $a$ and $b$, we have that $\\mu_{aX+b} = a\\mu_X + b$.\n",
    "* If we have two random variables $X$ and $Y$, we have $\\mu_{X+Y} = \\mu_X+\\mu_Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Means are useful for understanding the average behavior of a random variable, however the mean is not sufficient to even have a full intuitive understanding.  Making a profit of $\\$10 \\pm \\$1$ per sale is very different from making $\\$10 \\pm \\$15$ per sale despite having the same average value.  The second one has a much larger degree of fluctuation, and thus represents a much larger risk.  Thus, to understand the behavior of a random variable, we will need at minimum one more measure: some measure of how widely a random variable fluctuates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variances\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to consider the *variance* of a random variable.  This is a quantitative measure of how far a random variable deviates from the mean.  Consider the expression $X - \\mu_X$.  This is the deviation of the random variable from its mean.  This value can be positive or negative, so we need to do something to make it positive so that we are measuring the magnitude of the deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reasonable thing to try is to look at $\\left|X-\\mu_X\\right|$, and indeed this leads to a useful quantity called the *mean absolute deviation*, however due to connections with other areas of mathematics and statistics, people often use a different solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, they look at $(X-\\mu_X)^2.$  If we look at the typical size of this quantity by taking the mean, we arrive at the variance\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_X^2 = \\textrm{Var}(X) = E\\left[(X-\\mu_X)^2\\right] = E[X^2] - \\mu_X^2.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_var_def`\n",
    "\n",
    "The last equality in :eqref:`eq_var_def` holds by expanding out the definition in the middle, and applying the properties of expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at our example where $X$ is the random variable which takes the value $a-2$ with probability $p$, $a+2$ with probability $p$ and $a$ with probability $1-2p$.  In this case $\\mu_X = a$, so all we need to compute is $E\\left[X^2\\right]$.  This can readily be done:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E\\left[X^2\\right] = (a-2)^2p + a^2(1-2p) + (a+2)^2p = a^2 + 8p.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we see that by :eqref:`eq_var_def` our variance is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_X^2 = \\textrm{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - \\mu_X^2 = a^2 + 8p - a^2 = 8p.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This result again makes sense.  The largest $p$ can be is $1/2$ which corresponds to picking $a-2$ or $a+2$ with a coin flip.  The variance of this being $4$ corresponds to the fact that both $a-2$ and $a+2$ are $2$ units away from the mean, and $2^2 = 4$.  On the other end of the spectrum, if $p=0$, this random variable always takes the value $0$ and so it has no variance at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will list a few properties of variance below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For any random variable $X$, $\\textrm{Var}(X) \\ge 0$, with $\\textrm{Var}(X) = 0$ if and only if $X$ is a constant.\n",
    "* For any random variable $X$ and numbers $a$ and $b$, we have that $\\textrm{Var}(aX+b) = a^2\\textrm{Var}(X)$.\n",
    "* If we have two *independent* random variables $X$ and $Y$, we have $\\textrm{Var}(X+Y) = \\textrm{Var}(X) + \\textrm{Var}(Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interpreting these values, there can be a bit of a hiccup.  In particular, let's try imagining what happens if we keep track of units through this computation.  Suppose that we are working with the star rating assigned to a product on the web page.  Then $a$, $a-2$, and $a+2$ are all measured in units of stars.  Similarly, the mean $\\mu_X$ is then also measured in stars (being a weighted average).  However, if we get to the variance, we immediately encounter an issue, which is we want to look at $(X-\\mu_X)^2$, which is in units of *squared stars*.  This means that the variance itself is not comparable to the original measurements.  To make it interpretable, we will need to return to our original units.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Deviations\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary statistics can always be deduced from the variance by taking the square root!  Thus we define the *standard deviation* to be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_X = \\sqrt{\\textrm{Var}(X)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, this means we now have the standard deviation is $\\sigma_X = 2\\sqrt{2p}$.  If we are dealing with units of stars for our review example, $\\sigma_X$ is again in units of stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties we had for the variance can be restated for the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For any random variable $X$, $\\sigma_{X} \\ge 0$.\n",
    "* For any random variable $X$ and numbers $a$ and $b$, we have that $\\sigma_{aX+b} = |a|\\sigma_{X}$\n",
    "* If we have two *independent* random variables $X$ and $Y$, we have $\\sigma_{X+Y} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{X}^2 + \\sigma_{Y}^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is natural at this moment to ask, \"If the standard deviation is in the units of our original random variable, does it represent something we can draw with regards to that random variable?\"  The answer is a resounding yes!  Indeed much like the mean told us the typical location of our random variable, the standard deviation gives the typical range of variation of that random variable.  We can make this rigorous with what is known as Chebyshev's inequality:\n",
    "\n",

The question is, at what $p$ does that happen.  So we want to solve: for what $p$ does $a+4\\sqrt{2p} = a+2$, which is solved when $p=1/8$, which is *exactly* the first $p$ where it could possibly happen without violating our claim that no more than $1/4$ of samples from the distribution would fall outside the interval ($1/8$ to the left, and $1/8$ to the right).\n",

This circumstance is the norm in machine learning: imagine random variables like $R_{i, j}$ which encode the red value of the pixel at the $(i, j)$ coordinate in an image, or $P_t$ which is a random variable given by a stock price at time $t$.  Nearby pixels tend to have similar color, and nearby times tend to have similar prices.  We cannot treat them as separate random variables, and expect to create a successful model (we will see in :numref:`sec_naive_bayes` a model that under-performs due to such an assumption).  We need to develop the mathematical language to handle these correlated continuous random variables.\n",

    "* The probability density function allows us to work with continuous random variables by giving a function where the area under the curve on some interval gives the probability of finding a sample point in that interval.\n",
    "* The cumulative distribution function is the probability of observing the random variable to be less than a given threshold.  It can provide a useful alternate viewpoint which unifies discrete and continuous variables.\n",
    "* The mean is the average value of a random variable.\n",
    "* The variance is the expected square of the difference between the random variable and its mean.\n",
    "* The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.  It can be thought of as measuring the range of values the random variable may take.\n",
    "* Chebyshev's inequality allows us to make this intuition rigorous by giving an explicit interval that contains the random variable most of the time.\n",
    "* Joint densities allow us to work with correlated random variables.  We may marginalize joint densities by integrating over unwanted random variables to get the distribution of the desired random variable.\n",
    "* The covariance and correlation coefficient provide a way to measure any linear relationship between two correlated random variables.\n",
