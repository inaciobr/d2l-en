    "In :numref:`sec_calculus`, we saw the basic elements of differential calculus.  This section takes a deeper dive into the fundamentals of calculus and how we can understand and apply it in the context of machine learning.\n",

    "## Differential Calculus\n",
    "Differential calculus is fundamentally the study of how functions behave under small changes.  To see why this is so core to deep learning, let's consider an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we have a deep neural network where the weights are, for convenience, concatenated into a single vector $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, \\ldots, w_n)$.  Given a training dataset, we consider the loss of our neural network on this dataset, which we will write as $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is extraordinarily complex, encoding the performance of all possible models of the given architecture on this dataset, so it is nearly impossible to tell what set of weights $\\mathbf{w}$ will minimize the loss. Thus, in practice, we often start by initializing our weights *randomly*, and then iteratively take small steps in the direction which makes the loss decrease as rapidly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question then becomes something that on the surface is no easier: how do we find the direction which makes the weights decrease as quickly as possible?  To dig into this, let's first examine the case with only a single weight: $L(\\mathbf{w}) = L(x)$ for a single real value $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take $x$ and try to understand what happens when we change it by a small amount to $x + \\epsilon$. If you wish to be concrete, think a number like $\\epsilon = 0.0000001$.  To help us visualize what happens, let's graph an example function, $f(x) = \\sin(x^x)$, over the $[0, 3]$."

This is computationally inefficient, requiring two evaluations of the loss function to see how a single change of one variable influenced the loss.  If we tried to do this with even a paltry few thousand parameters, it would require several thousand evaluations of the network over the entire dataset!  It was not solved until 1986 that the *backpropagation algorithm* introduced in :citet:`Rumelhart.Hinton.Williams.ea.1988` provided a way to calculate how *any* change of the weights together would change the loss in the same computation time as a single prediction of the network over the dataset.\n",

    "As was seen in :numref:`sec_calculus`, when computing derivatives one can oftentimes use a series of rules to reduce the computation to a few core functions.  We repeat them here for ease of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Derivative of constants.** $\\frac{d}{dx}c = 0$.\n",
    "* **Derivative of linear functions.** $\\frac{d}{dx}(ax) = a$.\n",

    "* **Derivative of exponentials.** $\\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x$.\n",
    "* **Derivative of the logarithm.** $\\frac{d}{dx}\\log(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivative Rules\n",
    "If every derivative needed to be separately computed and stored in a table, differential calculus would be near impossible.  It is a gift of mathematics that we can generalize the above derivatives and compute more complex derivatives like finding the derivative of $f(x) = \\log\\left(1+(x-1)^{10}\\right)$.  As was mentioned in :numref:`sec_calculus`, the key to doing so is to codify what happens when we take functions and combine them in various ways, most importantly: sums, products, and compositions.\n",

    "Let's now do something that may on the surface seem strange.  Take a function $f$ and compute the derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}$.  This gives us the rate of change of $f$ at any point.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the derivative, $\\frac{df}{dx}$, can be viewed as a function itself, so nothing stops us from computing the derivative of $\\frac{df}{dx}$ to get $\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = \\frac{df}{dx}\\left(\\frac{df}{dx}\\right)$.  We will call this the second derivative of $f$.  This function is the rate of change of the rate of change of $f$, or in other words, how the rate of change is changing. We may apply the derivative any number of times to obtain what is called the $n$-th derivative. To keep the notation clean, we will denote the $n$-th derivative as\n",

    "Let's try to understand *why* this is a useful notion.  Below, we visualize $f^{(2)}(x)$, $f^{(1)}(x)$, and $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider the case that the second derivative $f^{(2)}(x)$ is a positive constant.  This means that the slope of the first derivative is positive.  As a result, the first derivative $f^{(1)}(x)$ may start out negative, becomes zero at a point, and then becomes positive in the end. This tells us the slope of our original function $f$ and therefore, the function $f$ itself decreases, flattens out, then increases.  In other words, the function $f$ curves up, and has a single minimum as is shown in :numref:`fig_positive-second`.\n",

    ":label:`fig_positive-second`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if the second derivative is a negative constant, that means that the first derivative is decreasing.  This implies the first derivative may start out positive, becomes zero at a point, and then becomes negative. Hence, the function $f$ itself increases, flattens out, then decreases.  In other words, the function $f$ curves down, and has a single maximum as is shown in :numref:`fig_negative-second`.\n",

    ":label:`fig_negative-second`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, if the second derivative is a always zero, then the first derivative will never change---it is constant!  This means that $f$ increases (or decreases) at a fixed rate, and $f$ is itself a straight line  as is shown in :numref:`fig_zero-second`.\n",

    "To summarize, the second derivative can be interpreted as describing the way that the function $f$ curves.  A positive second derivative leads to a upwards curve, while a negative second derivative means that $f$ curves downwards, and a zero second derivative means that $f$ does not curve at all.\n",
