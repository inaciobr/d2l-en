    "$$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{i}} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_{1}} \\frac{\\partial u_{1}}{\\partial x_{i}} + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_{2}} \\frac{\\partial u_{2}}{\\partial x_{i}} + \\ldots + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u_{m}} \\frac{\\partial u_{m}}{\\partial x_{i}} \\ \\textrm{ and so } \\ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} y =  \\mathbf{A} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} y,$$\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have just scratched the surface of a deep topic,\n",
    "a number of concepts already come into focus: \n",
    "first, the composition rules for differentiation\n",
    "can be applied routinely, enabling\n",
    "us to compute gradients *automatically*.\n",
    "This task requires no creativity and thus \n",
    "we can focus our cognitive powers elsewhere.\n",
    "Second, computing the derivatives of vector-valued functions \n",
    "requires us to multiply matrices as we trace \n",
    "the dependency graph of variables from output to input. \n",
    "In particular, this graph is traversed in a *forward* direction \n",
    "when we evaluate a function \n",
    "and in a *backwards* direction \n",
    "when we compute gradients. \n",
    "Later chapters will formally introduce backpropagation,\n",
    "a computational procedure for applying the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the viewpoint of optimization, gradients allow us \n",
    "to determine how to move the parameters of a model\n",
    "in order to lower the loss,\n",
    "and each step of the optimization algorithms used \n",
    "throughout this book will require calculating the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. So far we took the rules for derivatives for granted. \n",
    "   Using the definition and limits prove the properties \n",
    "   for (i) $f(x) = c$, (ii) $f(x) = x^n$, (iii) $f(x) = e^x$ and (iv) $f(x) = \\log x$.\n",
    "1. In the same vein, prove the product, sum, and quotient rule from first principles. \n",
    "1. Prove that the constant multiple rule follows as a special case of the product rule. \n",
    "1. Calculate the derivative of $f(x) = x^x$. \n",
    "1. What does it mean that $f'(x) = 0$ for some $x$? \n",
    "   Give an example of a function $f$ \n",
    "   and a location $x$ for which this might hold. \n",
    "1. Plot the function $y = f(x) = x^3 - \\frac{1}{x}$ \n",
    "   and plot its tangent line at $x = 1$.\n",
    "1. Find the gradient of the function \n",
    "   $f(\\mathbf{x}) = 3x_1^2 + 5e^{x_2}$.\n",
    "1. What is the gradient of the function \n",
    "   $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2$? What happens for $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$?\n",
    "1. Can you write out the chain rule for the case \n",
    "   where $u = f(x, y, z)$ and $x = x(a, b)$, $y = y(a, b)$, and $z = z(a, b)$?\n",
    "1. Given a function $f(x)$ that is invertible, \n",
    "   compute the derivative of its inverse $f^{-1}(x)$. \n",
    "   Here we have that $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ and conversely $f(f^{-1}(y)) = y$. \n",
    "   Hint: use these properties in your derivation. \n",
