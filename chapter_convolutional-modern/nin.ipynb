    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "NiN has dramatically fewer parameters than AlexNet and VGG. This stems primarily from the fact that it needs no giant fully connected layers. Instead, it uses global average pooling to aggregate across all image locations after the last stage of the network body. This obviates the need for expensive (learned) reduction operations and replaces them by a simple average. What surprised researchers at the time was the fact that this averaging operation did not harm accuracy. Note that averaging across a low-resolution representation (with many channels) also adds to the amount of translation invariance that the network can handle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing fewer convolutions with wide kernels and replacing them by $1 \\times 1$ convolutions aids the quest for fewer parameters further. It can cater for a significant amount of nonlinearity across channels within any given location. Both $1 \\times 1$ convolutions and global average pooling significantly influenced subsequent CNN designs. \n",
