    "# The Image Classification Dataset\n",
    ":label:`sec_fashion_mnist`\n",

    "(~~The MNIST dataset is one of the widely used dataset for image classification, while it is too simple as a benchmark dataset. We will use the similar, but more complex Fashion-MNIST dataset ~~)\n",
    "\n",
    "One widely used dataset for image classification is the  [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) :cite:`LeCun.Bottou.Bengio.ea.1998` of handwritten digits. At the time of its release in the 1990s it posed a formidable challenge to most machine learning algorithms, consisting of 60,000 images of $28 \\times 28$ pixels resolution (plus a test dataset of 10,000 images). To put things into perspective, back in 1995, a Sun SPARCStation 5 with a whopping 64MB of RAM and a blistering 5 MFLOPs was considered state of the art equipment for machine learning at AT&T Bell Laboratories. Achieving high accuracy on digit recognition was a key component in automating letter sorting for the USPS in the 1990s. Deep networks such as LeNet-5 :cite:`LeCun.Jackel.Bottou.ea.1995`, support vector machines with invariances :cite:`Scholkopf.Burges.Vapnik.1996`, and tangent distance classifiers :cite:`Simard.LeCun.Denker.ea.1998` all could reach error rates below 1%. \n",
    "\n",
    "For over a decade, MNIST served as *the* point of reference for comparing machine learning algorithms. \n",
    "While it had a good run as a benchmark dataset,\n",
    "even simple models by today's standards achieve classification accuracy over 95%,\n",
    "making it unsuitable for distinguishing between strong models and weaker ones. Even more, the dataset allows for *very* high levels of accuracy, not typically seen in many classification problems. This skewed algorithmic development towards specific families of algorithms that can take advantage of clean datasets, such as active set methods and boundary-seeking active set algorithms.\n",
    "Today, MNIST serves as more of a sanity check than as a benchmark. ImageNet :cite:`Deng.Dong.Socher.ea.2009` poses a much \n",
    "more relevant challenge. Unfortunately, ImageNet is too large for many of the examples and illustrations in this book, as it would take too long to train to make the examples interactive. As a substitute we will focus our discussion in the coming sections on the qualitatively similar, but much smaller Fashion-MNIST\n",
    "dataset :cite:`Xiao.Rasul.Vollgraf.2017` which was released in 2017. It contains images of 10 categories of clothing at $28 \\times 28$ pixels resolution."

We will use this dataset in subsequent sections and chapters to evaluate various network designs, from a simple linear model to advanced residual networks. As we commonly do with images, we read them as a tensor of shape (batch size, number of channels, height, width). For now, we only have one channel as the images are grayscale (the visualization above uses a false color palette for improved visibility). \n",

    "Lastly, data iterators are a key component for efficient performance. For instance, we might use GPUs for efficient image decompression, video transcoding, or other preprocessing. Whenever possible, you should rely on well-implemented data iterators that exploit high-performance computing to avoid slowing down your training loop.\n",
