    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the waiting time for random search substantially by distribution\n",
    "trials across parallel resources. In general, we distinguish between synchronous\n",
    "scheduling and asynchronous scheduling. Synchronous scheduling means that we\n",
    "sample a new batch of hyperparameter configurations once the previous batch\n",
    "finished. If we have a stragglers - trials that takes more time to finish than\n",
    "other trials - our workers need to wait at synchronization points. Asynchronous\n",
    "scheduling evaluates a new hyperparameter configurations as soon as resources\n",
    "become available, and, hence, ensures that all workers are busy at any point in\n",
    "time. While random search is easy to distribute asynchronously and does not\n",
    "require any change of the actual algorithm, other methods require some additional\n",
    "modifications.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider the `DropoutMLP` model implemented in :numref:`sec_dropout`, and used in Exercise 1 of :numref:`sec_api_hpo`.\n",
    "    1. Implement an objective function `hpo_objective_dropoutmlp_synetune` to be used with Syne Tune. Make sure that your function reports the validation error after every epoch.\n",
    "    2. Using the setup of Exercise 1 in :numref:`sec_api_hpo`, compare random search to Bayesian optimization. If you use SageMaker, feel free to use Syne Tune's benchmarking facilities in order to run experiments in parallel. Hint: Bayesian optimization is provided as `syne_tune.optimizer.baselines.BayesianOptimization`.\n",
    "    3. For this exercise, you need to run on an instance with at least 4 CPU cores. For one of the methods used above (random search, Bayesian optimization), run experiments with `n_workers=1`, `n_workers=2`, `n_workers=4`, and compare results (incumbent trajectories). At least for random search, you should observe linear scaling with respect to the number of workers. Hint: For robust results, you may have to average over several repetitions each.\n",
    "2. *Advanced*. The goal of this exercise is to implement a new scheduler in Syne Tune.\n",
    "    1. Create a virtual environment containing both the [d2lbook](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/blob/master/INFO.md#installation-for-developers) and [syne-tune](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) sources.\n",
    "    2. Implement the `LocalSearcher` from Exercise 2 in :numref:`sec_api_hpo` as a new searcher in Syne Tune. Hint: Read [this tutorial](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/developer/README.html). Alternatively, you may follow this [example](https://syne-tune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#launch-hpo-experiment-with-home-made-scheduler).\n",
