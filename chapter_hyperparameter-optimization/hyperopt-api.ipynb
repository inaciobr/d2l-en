    "\n",
    "This section laid out a simple, yet flexible interface to implement various HPO\n",
    "algorithms that we will look at in this chapter. Similar interfaces can be found\n",
    "in popular open-source HPO frameworks. We also looked at how we can compare HPO\n",
    "algorithms, and potential pitfall one needs to be aware. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The goal of this exercise is to implement the objective function for a slightly more challenging HPO problem, and to run more realistic experiments. We will use the two hidden layer MLP `DropoutMLP` implemented in :numref:`sec_dropout`.\n",
    "    1. Code up the objective function, which should depend on all hyperparameters of the model and `batch_size`. Use `max_epochs=50`. GPUs do not help here, so `num_gpus=0`. Hint: Modify `hpo_objective_lenet`.\n",
    "    2. Choose a sensible search space, where `num_hiddens_1`, `num_hiddens_2` are integers in $[8, 1024]$, and dropout values lie in $[0, 0.95]$, while `batch_size` lies in $[16, 384]$. Provide code for `config_space`, using sensible distributions from `scipy.stats`.\n",
    "    3. Run random search on this example with `number_of_trials=20` and plot the results. Make sure to first evaluate the default configuration of :numref:`sec_dropout`, which is `initial_config = {'num_hiddens_1': 256, 'num_hiddens_2': 256, 'dropout_1': 0.5, 'dropout_2': 0.5, 'lr': 0.1, 'batch_size': 256}`.\n",
    "2. In this exercise, you will implement a new searcher (subclass of `HPOSearcher`) which makes decisions based on past data. It depends on parameters `probab_local`, `num_init_random`. Its `sample_configuration` method works as follows. For the first `num_init_random` calls, do the same as `RandomSearcher.sample_configuration`. Otherwise, with probability `1 - probab_local`, do the same as `RandomSearcher.sample_configuration`. Otherwise, pick the configuration which attained the smallest validation error so far, select one of its hyperparameters at random, and sample its value randomly like in `RandomSearcher.sample_configuration`, but leave all other values the same. Return this configuration, which is identical to the best configuration so far, except in this one hyperparameter.\n",
    "    1. Code up this new `LocalSearcher`. Hint: Your searcher requires `config_space` as argument at construction. Feel free to use a member of type `RandomSearcher`. You will also have to implement the `update` method.\n",
    "    2. Re-run the experiment from the previous exercise, but using your new searcher instead of `RandomSearcher`. Experiment with different values for `probab_local`, `num_init_random`. However, note that a proper comparison between different HPO methods requires repeating experiments several times, and ideally considering a number of benchmark tasks.\n",
