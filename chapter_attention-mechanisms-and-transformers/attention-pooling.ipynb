This detour simply provides additional background: it is entirely optional and can be skipped if needed. \n",

    "There are many more choices that we could pick. See a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)) for a more extensive review and how the choice of kernels is related to kernel density estimation, sometimes also called *Parzen Windows* :cite:`parzen1957consistent`. All of the kernels are heuristic and can be tuned. For instance, we can adjust the width, not only on a global basis but even on a per-coordinate basis. Regardless, all of them lead to the following equation for regression and classification alike:\n",
    "\n",

    "In the case of a (scalar) regression with observations $(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$ for features and labels respectively, $\\mathbf{v}_i = y_i$ are scalars, $\\mathbf{k}_i = \\mathbf{x}_i$ are vectors, and the query $\\mathbf{q}$ denotes the new location where $f$ should be evaluated. In the case of (multiclass) classification, we use one-hot-encoding of $y_i$ to obtain $\\mathbf{v}_i$. One of the convenient properties of this estimator is that it requires no training. Even more so, if we suitably narrow the kernel with increasing amounts of data, the approach is consistent :cite:`mack1982weak`, i.e., it will converge to some statistically optimal solution. Let's start by inspecting some kernels."

    "Nadaraya--Watson kernel regression is an early precursor of the current attention mechanisms. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Parzen windows density estimates are given by $\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_i k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}_i)$. Prove that for binary classification the function $\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x}, y=1) - \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x}, y=-1)$, as obtained by Parzen windows is equivalent to Nadaraya--Watson classification. \n",
    "1. Implement stochastic gradient descent to learn a good value for kernel widths in Nadaraya--Watson regression. \n",
    "    1. What happens if you just use the above estimates to minimize $(f(\\mathbf{x_i}) - y_i)^2$ directly? Hint: $y_i$ is part of the terms used to compute $f$.\n",
    "    1. Remove $(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$ from the estimate for $f(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ and optimize over the kernel widths. Do you still observe overfitting?\n",
    "1. Assume that all $\\mathbf{x}$ lie on the unit sphere, i.e., all satisfy $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| = 1$. Can you simplify the $\\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_i\\|^2$ term in the exponential? Hint: we will later see that this is very closely related to dot product attention. \n",
    "1. Recall that :citet:`mack1982weak` proved that Nadaraya--Watson estimation is consistent. How quickly should you reduce the scale for the attention mechanism as you get more data? Provide some intuition for your answer. Does it depend on the dimensionality of the data? How?\n",
