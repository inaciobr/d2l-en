    "in various natural language processing tasks :cite:`Radford.Narasimhan.Salimans.ea.2018,Radford.Wu.Child.ea.2019,brown2020language,Devlin.Chang.Lee.ea.2018,raffel2020exploring`.\n",
    "However, in the field of computer vision\n",

    "Then, :citet:`cordonnier2020relationship` theoretically proved\n",
    "that self-attention can learn to behave similarly to convolution.\n",
    "Empirically, $2 \\times 2$ patches were taken from images as inputs,\n",

    "which will finally be transformed for classification :cite:`Dosovitskiy.Beyer.Kolesnikov.ea.2021`.\n",
    "Notably, Transformers show better scalability than CNNs:\n",
    "and when training larger models on larger datasets,\n",
    "vision Transformers outperform ResNets by a significant margin.\n",

    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that for small datasets like Fashion-MNIST,\n",
    "our implemented vision Transformer\n",
    "does not outperform the ResNet in :numref:`sec_resnet`.\n",
    "Similar observations can be made even on the ImageNet dataset (1.2 million images).\n",
    "This is because Transformers *lack* those useful principles in convolution,\n",
    "such as translation invariance and locality (:numref:`sec_why-conv`).\n",
    "However, the picture changes when training larger models on larger datasets (e.g., 300 million images),\n",
    "where vision Transformers outperform ResNets by a large margin in image classification, demonstrating\n",
    "intrinsic superiority of Transformers in scalability :cite:`Dosovitskiy.Beyer.Kolesnikov.ea.2021`.\n",
    "The introduction of vision Transformers\n",
    "has changed the landscape of network design for modeling image data.\n",
    "They were soon shown to be effective on the ImageNet dataset\n",
    "with data-efficient training strategies of DeiT :cite:`touvron2021training`.\n",
    "However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention\n",
    "(:numref:`sec_self-attention-and-positional-encoding`)\n",
    "makes the Transformer architecture\n",
    "less suitable for higher-resolution images.\n",
    "Towards a general-purpose backbone network in computer vision,\n",
    "Swin Transformers addressed the quadratic computational complexity\n",
    "with respect to image size (:numref:`subsec_cnn-rnn-self-attention`)\n",
    "and reinstated convolution-like priors,\n",
    "extending the applicability of Transformers to a range of computer vision tasks\n",
    "beyond image classification with state-of-the-art results :cite:`liu2021swin`.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the value of `img_size` affect training time?\n",
    "1. Instead of projecting the “&lt;cls&gt;” token representation to the output, how would you project the averaged patch representations? Implement this change and see how it affects the accuracy.\n",
