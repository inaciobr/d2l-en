    "A Gaussian process is defined as _a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution_. If a function $f(x)$ is a Gaussian process, with _mean function_ $m(x)$ and _covariance function_ or _kernel_ $k(x,x')$, $f(x) \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m, k)$, then any collection of function values queried at any collection of input points $x$ (times, spatial locations, image pixels, etc.), has a joint multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean vector $\\mu$ and covariance matrix $K$: $f(x_1),\\dots,f(x_n) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, K)$, where $\\mu_i = E[f(x_i)] = m(x_i)$ and $K_{ij} = \\textrm{Cov}(f(x_i),f(x_j)) = k(x_i,x_j)$.\n",

    "For any $x$, $f(x)$ is a sum of two Gaussian random variables. Since Gaussians are closed under addition, $f(x)$ is also a Gaussian random variable for any $x$. In fact, we can compute for any particular $x$ that $f(x)$ is $\\mathcal{N}(0,1+x^2)$. Similarly, the joint distribution for any collection of function values, $(f(x_1),\\dots,f(x_n))$, for any collection of inputs $x_1,\\dots,x_n$, is a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Therefore $f(x)$ is a Gaussian process.\n",

We can gain some insights into this distribution by repeatedly sampling values for $w_0, w_1$, and visualizing the corresponding functions $f(x)$, which are straight lines with slopes and different intercepts, as follows:"

    "In the plot above, we saw how a distribution over parameters in a model induces a distribution over functions. While we often have ideas about the functions we want to model --- whether they're smooth, periodic, quickly varying, etc. --- it is relatively tedious to reason about the parameters, which are largely uninterpretable. Fortunately, Gaussian processes provide an easy mechanism to reason _directly_ about functions. Since a Gaussian distribution is entirely defined by its first two moments, its mean and covariance matrix, a Gaussian process by extension is defined by its mean function and covariance function.\n",

We will begin to see just how advantageous this formulation will be.\n",

In this case, the mean function $m(x) = u^{\\top}\\phi(x)$, and the covariance function $k(x,x') = \\phi(x)^{\\top}S\\phi(x')$. Since $\\phi(x)$ can represent a vector of any non-linear basis functions, we are considering a very general model class, including models with an even an _infinite_ number of parameters.\n",

    "It is worth taking a moment to absorb what we have done here. By moving into the function space representation, we have derived how to represent a model with an _infinite_ number of parameters, using a finite amount of computation. A Gaussian process with an RBF kernel is a _universal approximator_, capable of representing any continuous function to arbitrary precision. We can intuitively see why from the above derivation. We can collapse each radial basis function to a point mass taking $\\ell \\to 0$, and give each point mass any height we wish.\n",

Moreover, the examples in :cite:`zhang2021understanding`, such as the ability to fit images with random labels perfectly, but still generalize well on structured problems, (can be perfectly reproduced using Gaussian processes) :cite:`wilson2020bayesian`. Neural networks are not as distinct as we make them out to be.\n",

    "3. Sample from this multivariate Gaussian distribution to obtain the sample function values.\n",

Interest in this derivation has re-surfaced, with ideas like the neural tangent kernel being used to investigate the generalization properties of neural networks :cite:`matthews2018gaussian` :cite:`novak2018bayesian`. We can derive the neural network kernel as follows.\n",

    "$b$ is a bias, $v_i$ are the hidden to output weights, $h$ is any bounded hidden unit transfer function, $u_i$ are the input to hidden weights, and $J$ is the number of hidden units. Let $b$ and $v_i$ be independent with zero mean and variances $\\sigma_b^2$ and $\\sigma_v^2/J$, respectively, and let the $u_i$ have independent identical distributions. We can then use the central limit theorem to show that any collection of function values $f(x_1),\\dots,f(x_n)$ has a joint multivariate Gaussian distribution.\n",

    "The RBF kernel is _stationary_, meaning that it is _translation invariant_, and therefore can be written as a function of $\\tau = x-x'$. Intuitively, stationarity means that the high-level properties of the function, such as rate of variation, do not change as we move in input space. The neural network kernel, however, is _non-stationary_. Below, we show sample functions from a Gaussian process with this kernel. We can see that the function looks qualitatively different near the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in performing Bayesian inference involves specifying a prior. Gaussian processes can be used to specify a whole prior over functions. Starting from a traditional \"weight space\" view of modelling, we can induce a prior over functions by starting with the functional form of a model, and introducing a distribution over its parameters. We can alternatively specify a prior distribution directly in function space, with properties controlled by a kernel. The function-space approach has many advantages. We can build models that actually correspond to an infinite number of parameters, but use a finite amount of computation! Moreover, while these models have a great amount of flexibility, they also make strong assumptions about what types of functions are a priori likely, leading to relatively good generalization on small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions of models in function space are intuitively controlled by kernels, which often encode higher level properties of functions, such as smoothness and periodicity. Many kernels are stationary, meaning that they are translation invariant. Functions drawn from a Gaussian process with a stationary kernel have roughly the same high-level properties (such as rate of variation) regardless of where we look in the input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian processes are a relatively general model class, containing many examples of models we are already familiar with, including polynomials, Fourier series, and so on, as long as we have a Gaussian prior over the parameters. They also include neural networks with an infinite number of parameters, even without Gaussian distributions over the parameters. This connection, discovered by Radford Neal, triggered machine learning researchers to move away from neural networks, and towards Gaussian processes.\n",
