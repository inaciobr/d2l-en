    "\n",
    "Text is among the most common forms of sequence data encountered in deep learning.\n",
    "Common choices for what constitutes a token are characters, words, and word pieces.\n",
    "To preprocess text, we usually (i) split text into tokens; (ii) build a vocabulary to map token strings to numerical indices; and (iii) convert text data into token indices for models to manipulate.\n",
    "In practice, the frequency of words tends to follow Zipf's law. This is true not just for individual words (unigrams), but also for $n$-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the experiment of this section, tokenize text into words and vary the `min_freq` argument value of the `Vocab` instance. Qualitatively characterize how changes in `min_freq` impact the size of the resulting vocabulary.\n",
    "1. Estimate the exponent of Zipfian distribution for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams in this corpus.\n",
    "1. Find some other sources of data (download a standard machine learning dataset, pick another public domain book,\n",
    "   scrape a website, etc). For each, tokenize the data at both the word and character levels. How do the vocabulary sizes compare with *The Time Machine* corpus at equivalent values of `min_freq`. Estimate the exponent of the Zipfian distribution corresponding to the unigram and bigram distributions for these corpora. How do they compare with the values that you observed for *The Time Machine* corpus?\n",
