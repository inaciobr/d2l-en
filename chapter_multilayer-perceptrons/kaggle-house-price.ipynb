    "\n",
    "Real data often contains a mix of different data types and needs to be preprocessed.\n",
    "Rescaling real-valued data to zero mean and unit variance is a good default. So is replacing missing values with their mean.\n",
    "Furthermore, transforming categorical features into indicator features allows us to treat them like one-hot vectors.\n",
    "When we tend to care more about\n",
    "the relative error than about the absolute error,\n",
    "we can \n",
    "measure the discrepancy in the logarithm of the prediction.\n",
    "To select the model and adjust the hyperparameters,\n",
    "we can use $K$-fold cross-validation .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit your predictions for this section to Kaggle. How good are they?\n",
    "1. Is it always a good idea to replace missing values by a mean? Hint: can you construct a situation where the values are not missing at random?\n",
    "1. Improve the score by tuning the hyperparameters through $K$-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "1. Improve the score by improving the model (e.g., layers, weight decay, and dropout).\n",
    "1. What happens if we do not standardize the continuous numerical features as we have done in this section?\n",
