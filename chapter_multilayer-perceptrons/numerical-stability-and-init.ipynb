    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanishing and exploding gradients are common issues in deep networks. Great care in parameter initialization is required to ensure that gradients and parameters remain well controlled.\n",
    "Initialization heuristics are needed to ensure that the initial gradients are neither too large nor too small.\n",
    "Random initialization is key to ensuring that symmetry is broken before optimization.\n",
    "Xavier initialization suggests that, for each layer, variance of any output is not affected by the number of inputs, and variance of any gradient is not affected by the number of outputs.\n",
    "ReLU activation functions mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. This can accelerate convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can you design other cases where a neural network might exhibit symmetry that needs breaking, besides the permutation symmetry in an MLP's layers?\n",
    "1. Can we initialize all weight parameters in linear regression or in softmax regression to the same value?\n",
    "1. Look up analytic bounds on the eigenvalues of the product of two matrices. What does this tell you about ensuring that gradients are well conditioned?\n",
    "1. If we know that some terms diverge, can we fix this after the fact? Look at the paper on layerwise adaptive rate scaling  for inspiration :cite:`You.Gitman.Ginsburg.2017`.\n",
