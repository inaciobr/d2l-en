    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the nice properties of convex optimization is that it allows us to handle constraints efficiently. That is, it allows us to solve *constrained optimization* problems of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} \\mathop{\\textrm{minimize~}}_{\\mathbf{x}} & f(\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\n",
    "    \\textrm{ subject to } & c_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\leq 0 \\textrm{ for all } i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\},\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is the objective and the functions $c_i$ are constraint functions. To see what this does consider the case where $c_1(\\mathbf{x}) = \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2 - 1$. In this case the parameters $\\mathbf{x}$ are constrained to the unit ball. If a second constraint is $c_2(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{x} + b$, then this corresponds to all $\\mathbf{x}$ lying on a half-space. Satisfying both constraints simultaneously amounts to selecting a slice of a ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lagrangian\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, solving a constrained optimization problem is difficult. One way of addressing it stems from physics with a rather simple intuition. Imagine a ball inside a box. The ball will roll to the place that is lowest and the forces of gravity will be balanced out with the forces that the sides of the box can impose on the ball. In short, the gradient of the objective function (i.e., gravity) will be offset by the gradient of the constraint function (the ball need to remain inside the box by virtue of the walls \"pushing back\"). \n",
    "Note that some constraints may not be active:\n",
    "the walls that are not touched by the ball\n",
    "will not be able to exert any force on the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Skipping over the derivation of the *Lagrangian* $L$,\n",
    "the above reasoning\n",
    "can be expressed via the following saddle point optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\mathbf{x}, \\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n) = f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i c_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\textrm{ where } \\alpha_i \\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the variables $\\alpha_i$ ($i=1,\\ldots,n$) are the so-called *Lagrange multipliers* that ensure that constraints are properly enforced. They are chosen just large enough to ensure that $c_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\leq 0$ for all $i$. For instance, for any $\\mathbf{x}$ where $c_i(\\mathbf{x}) < 0$ naturally, we'd end up picking $\\alpha_i = 0$. Moreover, this is a saddle point optimization problem where one wants to *maximize* $L$ with respect to all $\\alpha_i$ and simultaneously *minimize* it with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$. There is a rich body of literature explaining how to arrive at the function $L(\\mathbf{x}, \\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n)$. For our purposes it is sufficient to know that the saddle point of $L$ is where the original constrained optimization problem is solved optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of satisfying constrained optimization problems at least *approximately* is to adapt the Lagrangian $L$. \n",
    "Rather than satisfying $c_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\leq 0$ we simply add $\\alpha_i c_i(\\mathbf{x})$ to the objective function $f(x)$. This ensures that the constraints will not be violated too badly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we have been using this trick all along. Consider weight decay in :numref:`sec_weight_decay`. In it we add $\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2$ to the objective function to ensure that $\\mathbf{w}$ does not grow too large. From the constrained optimization point of view we can see that this will ensure that $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2 - r^2 \\leq 0$ for some radius $r$. Adjusting the value of $\\lambda$ allows us to vary the size of $\\mathbf{w}$.\n",

    "In general, adding penalties is a good way of ensuring approximate constraint satisfaction. In practice this turns out to be much more robust than exact satisfaction. Furthermore, for nonconvex problems many of the properties that make the exact approach so appealing in the convex case (e.g., optimality) no longer hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projections\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative strategy for satisfying constraints is projections. Again, we encountered them before, e.g., when dealing with gradient clipping in :numref:`sec_rnn-scratch`. There we ensured that a gradient has length bounded by $\\theta$ via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{g} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathrm{min}(1, \\theta/\\|\\mathbf{g}\\|).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be a *projection* of $\\mathbf{g}$ onto the ball of radius $\\theta$. More generally, a projection on a convex set $\\mathcal{X}$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{Proj}_\\mathcal{X}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_{\\mathbf{x}' \\in \\mathcal{X}} \\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}'\\|,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the closest point in $\\mathcal{X}$ to $\\mathbf{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Convex Projections.](../img/projections.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_projections`\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical definition of projections may sound a bit abstract. :numref:`fig_projections` explains it somewhat more clearly. In it we have two convex sets, a circle and a diamond. \n",
    "Points inside both sets (yellow) remain unchanged during projections. \n",
    "Points outside both sets (black) are projected to \n",
    "the points inside the sets (red) that are closet to the original points (black).\n",
    "While for $\\ell_2$ balls this leaves the direction unchanged, this need not be the case in general, as can be seen in the case of the diamond.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the uses for convex projections is to compute sparse weight vectors. In this case we project weight vectors onto an $\\ell_1$ ball,\n",
    "which is a generalized version of the diamond case in :numref:`fig_projections`.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of deep learning the main purpose of convex functions is to motivate optimization algorithms and help us understand them in detail. In the following we will see how gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent can be derived accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Intersections of convex sets are convex. Unions are not.\n",
    "* The expectation of a convex function is no less than the convex function of an expectation (Jensen's inequality).\n",
    "* A twice-differentiable function is convex if and only if its Hessian (a matrix of second derivatives) is positive semidefinite.\n",
    "* Convex constraints can be added via the Lagrangian. In practice we may simply add them with a penalty to the objective function.\n",
    "* Projections map to points in the convex set closest to the original points.\n",
