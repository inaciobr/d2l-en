Even after 50 steps the quality is still not so good. Even worse, it will not improve after additional steps (we encourage you to experiment with a larger number of steps to confirm this).

In particular, for a finite sample size we simply argued that the discrete distribution $p(x, y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{x_i}(x) \\delta_{y_i}(y)$\n",

Instead we iterated over all instances *exactly once*.

    "1. Experiment with different learning rate schedules for stochastic gradient descent and with different numbers of iterations. In particular, plot the distance from the optimal solution $(0, 0)$ as a function of the number of iterations.\n",
    "1. Prove that for the function $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + 2 x_2^2$ adding normal noise to the gradient is equivalent to minimizing a loss function $f(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{w}) = (x_1 - w_1)^2 + 2 (x_2 - w_2)^2$ where $\\mathbf{x}$ is drawn from a normal distribution.\n",
    "1. Compare convergence of stochastic gradient descent when you sample from $\\{(x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)\\}$ with replacement and when you sample without replacement.\n",
    "1. How would you change the stochastic gradient descent solver if some gradient (or rather some coordinate associated with it) was consistently larger than all the other gradients?\n",
    "1. Assume that $f(x) = x^2 (1 + \\sin x)$. How many local minima does $f$ have? Can you change $f$ in such a way that to minimize it one needs to evaluate all the local minima?\n",
