    "\n",
    "In this section we are going to introduce the basic concepts underlying *gradient descent*.\n",
    "Although it is rarely used directly in deep learning, an understanding of gradient descent is key to understanding stochastic gradient descent algorithms.\n",
    "For instance, the optimization problem might diverge due to an overly large learning rate. This phenomenon can already be seen in gradient descent. Likewise, preconditioning is a common technique in gradient descent and carries over to more advanced algorithms.\n",
    "Let's start with a simple special case.\n",

    "\n",
    "## One-Dimensional Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent in one dimension is an excellent example to explain why the gradient descent algorithm may reduce the value of the objective function. Consider some continuously differentiable real-valued function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Using a Taylor expansion we obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x + \\epsilon) = f(x) + \\epsilon f'(x) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2).$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`gd-taylor`\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, in first-order approximation $f(x+\\epsilon)$ is given by the function value $f(x)$ and the first derivative $f'(x)$ at $x$. It is not unreasonable to assume that for small $\\epsilon$ moving in the direction of the negative gradient will decrease $f$. To keep things simple we pick a fixed step size $\\eta > 0$ and choose $\\epsilon = -\\eta f'(x)$. Plugging this into the Taylor expansion above we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x - \\eta f'(x)) = f(x) - \\eta f'^2(x) + \\mathcal{O}(\\eta^2 f'^2(x)).$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`gd-taylor-2`\n",
    "\n",
    "If the derivative $f'(x) \\neq 0$ does not vanish we make progress since $\\eta f'^2(x)>0$. Moreover, we can always choose $\\eta$ small enough for the higher-order terms to become irrelevant. Hence we arrive at\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x - \\eta f'(x)) \\lessapprox f(x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, if we use\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\leftarrow x - \\eta f'(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "to iterate $x$, the value of function $f(x)$ might decline. Therefore, in gradient descent we first choose an initial value $x$ and a constant $\\eta > 0$ and then use them to continuously iterate $x$ until the stop condition is reached, for example, when the magnitude of the gradient $|f'(x)|$ is small enough or the number of iterations has reached a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we choose the objective function $f(x)=x^2$ to illustrate how to implement gradient descent. Although we know that $x=0$ is the solution to minimize $f(x)$, we still use this simple function to observe how $x$ changes."

This seems to defeat the purpose, but not quite. Having second-order information allows us to be cautious whenever the curvature is large and to take longer steps whenever the objective function is flatter.\n",

    "### Convergence Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We only analyze the convergence rate of Newton's method for some convex and three times differentiable objective function $f$, where the second derivative is nonzero, i.e., $f'' > 0$. The multivariate proof is a straightforward extension of the one-dimensional argument below and omitted since it does not help us much in terms of intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote by $x^{(k)}$ the value of $x$ at the $k^\\textrm{th}$ iteration and let $e^{(k)} \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} x^{(k)} - x^*$ be the distance from optimality at the $k^\\textrm{th}$ iteration. By Taylor  expansion we have that the condition $f'(x^*) = 0$ can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = f'(x^{(k)} - e^{(k)}) = f'(x^{(k)}) - e^{(k)} f''(x^{(k)}) + \\frac{1}{2} (e^{(k)})^2 f'''(\\xi^{(k)}),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which holds for some $\\xi^{(k)} \\in [x^{(k)} - e^{(k)}, x^{(k)}]$. Dividing the above expansion by $f''(x^{(k)})$ yields\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{(k)} - \\frac{f'(x^{(k)})}{f''(x^{(k)})} = \\frac{1}{2} (e^{(k)})^2 \\frac{f'''(\\xi^{(k)})}{f''(x^{(k)})}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we have the update $x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} - f'(x^{(k)}) / f''(x^{(k)})$.\n",
    "Plugging in this update equation and taking the absolute value of both sides, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|e^{(k+1)}\\right| = \\frac{1}{2}(e^{(k)})^2 \\frac{\\left|f'''(\\xi^{(k)})\\right|}{f''(x^{(k)})}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, whenever we are in a region of bounded $\\left|f'''(\\xi^{(k)})\\right| / (2f''(x^{(k)})) \\leq c$, we have a quadratically decreasing error\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|e^{(k+1)}\\right| \\leq c (e^{(k)})^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, optimization researchers call this *linear* convergence, whereas a condition such as $\\left|e^{(k+1)}\\right| \\leq \\alpha \\left|e^{(k)}\\right|$ would be called a *constant* rate of convergence.\n",
    "Note that this analysis comes with a number of caveats.\n",
    "First, we do not really have much of a guarantee when we will reach the region of rapid convergence. Instead, we only know that once we reach it, convergence will be very quick. Second, this analysis requires that $f$ is well-behaved up to higher-order derivatives. It comes down to ensuring that $f$ does not have any \"surprising\" properties in terms of how it might change its values.\n",

    "### Preconditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite unsurprisingly computing and storing the full Hessian is very expensive. It is thus desirable to find alternatives. One way to improve matters is *preconditioning*. It avoids computing the Hessian in its entirety but only computes the *diagonal* entries. This leads to update algorithms of the form\n",

    "$$\\mathbf{x} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{x} - \\eta \\textrm{diag}(\\mathbf{H})^{-1} \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is not quite as good as the full Newton's method, it is still much better than not using it.\n",
    "To see why this might be a good idea consider a situation where one variable denotes height in millimeters and the other one denotes height in kilometers. Assuming that for both the natural scale is in meters, we have a terrible mismatch in parametrizations. Fortunately, using preconditioning removes this. Effectively preconditioning with gradient descent amounts to selecting a different learning rate for each variable (coordinate of vector $\\mathbf{x}$).\n",
    "As we will see later, preconditioning drives some of the innovation in stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent with Line Search\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key problems in gradient descent is that we might overshoot the goal or make insufficient progress. A simple fix for the problem is to use line search in conjunction with gradient descent. That is, we use the direction given by $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})$ and then perform binary search as to which learning rate $\\eta$ minimizes $f(\\mathbf{x} - \\eta \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm converges rapidly (for an analysis and proof see e.g., :citet:`Boyd.Vandenberghe.2004`). However, for the purpose of deep learning this is not quite so feasible, since each step of the line search would require us to evaluate the objective function on the entire dataset. This is way too costly to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning rates matter. Too large and we diverge, too small and we do not make progress.\n",
    "* Gradient descent can get stuck in local minima.\n",
    "* In high dimensions adjusting the learning rate is complicated.\n",
    "* Preconditioning can help with scale adjustment.\n",
    "* Newton's method is a lot faster once it has started working properly in convex problems.\n",
    "* Beware of using Newton's method without any adjustments for nonconvex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment with different learning rates and objective functions for gradient descent.\n",
    "1. Implement line search to minimize a convex function in the interval $[a, b]$.\n",
    "    1. Do you need derivatives for binary search, i.e., to decide whether to pick $[a, (a+b)/2]$ or $[(a+b)/2, b]$.\n",
    "    1. How rapid is the rate of convergence for the algorithm?\n",
    "    1. Implement the algorithm and apply it to minimizing $\\log (\\exp(x) + \\exp(-2x -3))$.\n",
    "1. Design an objective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ where gradient descent is exceedingly slow. Hint: scale different coordinates differently.\n",
    "1. Implement the lightweight version of Newton's method using preconditioning:\n",
    "    1. Use diagonal Hessian as preconditioner.\n",
    "    1. Use the absolute values of that rather than the actual (possibly signed) values.\n",
    "    1. Apply this to the problem above.\n",
    "1. Apply the algorithm above to a number of objective functions (convex or not). What happens if you rotate coordinates by $45$ degrees?\n",
